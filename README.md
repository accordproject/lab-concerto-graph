# Concerto Graph

This project uses a [Concerto model](https://concerto.accordproject.org) to define the nodes and edges in a Neo4J graph database and uses the model to validate the properties on the nodes.

![demo](demo.png)
[Demo](src/demo/index.ts)

In a few lines of code you can define a Concerto data model validated graph and perform a vector similarity search over
nodes with text content.

Concerto model (snippet):

```
concept Movie extends GraphNode {
  @vector_index("summary", 1536, "COSINE")
  o Double[] embedding optional
  @embedding
  o String summary optional
  @label("IN_GENRE")
  --> Genre[] genres optional
}
```

## Graph Model

The data model for the graph (the definition of the structure of the nodes and edges) is specified
using a [Concerto model](https://concerto.accordproject.org). The nodes in the graph should extend
`GraphNode`. 

Here is a very simple sample model for books: each book is related to a Genre. A book has a
`summary` property that is full-text searchable as well as searchable using a vector
similarity search.

```
@description("Ask questions about books and book genres.")
namespace test@1.0.0
import org.accordproject.graph@1.0.0.{GraphNode}

@questions("How many books genres do we have?")
concept Genre extends GraphNode {
}

@questions("How many books do we have?", 
"Find a book about the theme of natural disasters", 
"Find a book containing the phrase 'Disaster Capitalism'")
concept Book extends GraphNode {
  o Double[] embedding optional
  @vector_index("embedding", 1536, "COSINE")
  @fulltext_index
  o String summary optional
  @label("IN_GENRE")
  --> Genre[] genres optional
}
```

### Decorators

1. `@description` is placed on the namespace and describes the general types of questions that can be asked of this model
2. `@vector_index` is placed on `String` properties to make them vector similarity searchable. The first argument to the decorator specifies the name of a property of type `Double[]` that is used to store the vector embeddings for the text in the `String` property
3. `@fulltext_index` is placed on `String` properties to make them fulltext searchable
4. `@label` is placed on relationships `-->` to indicate the type of an edge
5. `@questions` is placed on concepts that extend `GraphNode` to supply sample questions that can be asked about this type of node

## Install

```bash
npm i @accordproject/concerto-graph@unstable --save
```

> Note you may want to pin to a specific version, however this package is currently changing frequently.

## Adding Nodes and Edges to the Graph

```typescript
    await graphModel.mergeNode(transaction, `${NS}.Movie`, {identifier: 'Brazil', summary: 'The film centres on Sam Lowry, a low-ranking bureaucrat trying to find a woman who appears in his dreams while he is working in a mind-numbing job and living in a small apartment, set in a dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poorly maintained (and rather whimsical) machines'} );
    
    await graphModel.mergeNode(transaction, `${NS}.Genre`, {identifier: 'Comedy'} );
    
    await graphModel.mergeRelationship(transaction, `${NS}.Movie`, 'Brazil', `${NS}.Genre`, 'Comedy', 'genres' );
    
    await graphModel.mergeNode(transaction, `${NS}.Director`, {identifier: 'Terry Gilliam'} );
    await graphModel.mergeRelationship(transaction, `${NS}.Director`, 'Terry Gilliam', `${NS}.Movie`, 'Brazil', 'directed' );
    
    await graphModel.mergeNode(transaction, `${NS}.Actor`, {identifier: 'Jonathan Pryce'} );
    await graphModel.mergeRelationship(transaction, `${NS}.Actor`, 'Jonathan Pryce', `${NS}.Movie`, 'Brazil', 'actedIn' );    
```

## Fulltext Query

```typescript
    const fullTextSearch = 'bats';
    console.log(`Full text search for movies with: '${fullTextSearch}'`);
    const results = await graphModel.fullTextQuery('Movie', fullTextSearch, 2);
    console.log(results);  
```

Output:

```json
[
  {
    summary: 'Duke, under the influence of mescaline, complains of a swarm of giant bats, and inventories their drug stash. They pick up a young hitchhiker and explain their mission: Duke has been assigned by a magazine to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race in Las Vegas. They bought excessive drugs for the trip, and rented a red Chevrolet Impala convertible.',
    score: 0.4010826349258423,
    identifier: 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'
  }
]
```

## Similarity Query

```typescript
    const search = 'Working in a boring job and looking for love.';
    const results = await graphModel.similarityQuery(`${NS}.Movie`, 'embedding', search, 3);
```

Output:

```json
[
  {
    identifier: 'Brazil',
    content: 'The film centres on Sam Lowry, a low-ranking bureaucrat trying to find a woman who appears in his dreams while he is working in a mind-numbing job and living in a small apartment, set in a dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poorly maintained (and rather whimsical) machines',
    score: 0.901830792427063
  }
]
```

## Chat with your data (Cypher generation)

You can also "chat with your data" â€” converting natural language queries to Neo4J Cypher
queries and running them over your graph.

```typescript
    const chat = 'Which director has directed both Johnny Depp and Jonathan Pryce, but not necessarily in the same movie?';
    console.log(`Chat with data: ${chat}`);
    const cypher = await graphModel.textToCypher(chat);
    console.log(`Converted to Cypher query: ${cypher}`);    
    const chatResult = await graphModel.chatWithData(chat);
    console.log(JSON.stringify(chatResult, null, 2));
```

Output:

```
Chat with data: Which director has directed both Johnny Depp and Jonathan Pryce, but not necessarily in the same movie?
Converted to Cypher query: MATCH (d:Director)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a1:Actor {identifier: 'Johnny Depp'}),
      (d)-[:DIRECTED]->(m2:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a2:Actor {identifier: 'Jonathan Pryce'})
RETURN d.identifier
[
  {
    "d.identifier": "Terry Gilliam"
  },
  {
    "d.identifier": "Terry Gilliam"
  }
]
```
 
 Natural language queries can even contain expressions that use the conceptual search (vector similarity)!

 ```typescript
    const search = 'working in a boring job and looking for love.';
    const chat2 = `Which director has directed a movie that is about the concepts of ${search}? Return a single movie.`;
    const chatResult2 = await graphModel.chatWithData(chat2);
    console.log(JSON.stringify(chatResult2, null, 2));
```

Output:

```
Calling tool: get_embeddings
Tool replacing embeddings: MATCH (d:Director)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('movie_summary', 1, <EMBEDDINGS>)
YIELD node AS similar, score
MATCH (similar)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d)
RETURN d.identifier as director, similar.identifier as movie, similar.summary as summary, score limit 1
[
  {
    "director": "Terry Gilliam",
    "movie": "Brazil",
    "summary": "The film centres on Sam Lowry, a low-ranking bureaucrat trying to find a woman who appears in his dreams while he is working in a mind-numbing job and living in a small apartment, set in a dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poorly maintained (and rather whimsical) machines",
    "score": 0.7065110206604004
  }
]
```

## Conversations

Use the Conversation class to maintain a long-running "chat with your data" context, allowing
you to ask follow-up questions. This capability exposes the GraphModel as an Open AI Tool â€”
allowing the LLM to call into the GraphModel to answer questions.

```typescript
      const convo = new Conversation(graphModel, {
        toolOptions: {
          getById: true,
          chatWithData: true
        }
      });      
      let result = await convo.appendUserMessage('Tell me a joke about actors');
      console.log(result);
      result = await convo.appendUserMessage('Which actor acted in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas?');
      console.log(result);
      result = await convo.appendUserMessage('Who directed that movie?');
      console.log(result);
      result = await convo.appendUserMessage('How many movies do we have?');
      console.log(result);
```

Output:

```
Sure, here's a joke about actors for you:

Why did the scarecrow become an actor?

Because he was outstanding in his field! ðŸ˜„

> Generated Cypher: MATCH (m:Movie {identifier: 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'})<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Actor)
RETURN a.identifier

Johnny Depp acted in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."

> Generated Cypher: MATCH (m:Movie {identifier: 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'})<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Director)
RETURN d.identifier

"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" was directed by Terry Gilliam.

> Generated Cypher: MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN count(m) as total_movies

We have a total of 3 movies in our database.
```
